# Reverse an Array
Code Fellows 401 Java Code Challenge 1

## Challenge
Write a function called reverseArray which takes an array as an argument. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with elements in reversed order.

## Approach & Efficiency
1. Create an array of the same type and size as the input array.
2. Iterate backward through the input array.
3. Copy each element from the input array into the new array moving from the last index to the first.
4. Return the new array.
