# Stack
Java implementation of a stack data structure.

## Challenge
Implement a stack data structure with a constructor and the following methods: push, pop, peek, isEmpty.

## Approach & Efficiency
1. Develop tests for each of the following
2. This object should be aware of a default empty value assigned to top when the stack is created.
3. Define a method called push which takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the top of the stack with an O(1) Time performance.
4. Define a method called pop that does not take any argument, removes the node from the top of the stack, and returns the nodeâ€™s value.
5. Define a method called peek that does not take an argument and returns the value of the node located on top of the stack, without removing it from the stack.
6. Define a method called isEmpty that does not take an argument, and returns a boolean indicating whether or not the stack is empty.
7. Test
